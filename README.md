# Textattack-complete-feature-in-one
##Performed all the main features highlighted by text attack python framework 




This project explores the use of the **TextAttack** framework, as described in the paper ["TextAttack: A Framework for Adversarial Attacks, Data Augmentation, and Adversarial Training in NLP"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05909). The paper introduces TextAttack as a modular and extensible Python library that simplifies creating, testing, and benchmarking adversarial attacks on Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. Using this framework, we evaluate the robustness of NLP models through adversarial attacks, measure their effectiveness, and explore advanced features for generating adversarial examples.

## Purpose of the Notebook

This notebook is designed to:
1. Evaluate the robustness of NLP models by generating adversarial examples.
2. Use pre-defined attack recipes from the TextAttack framework to perturb input text while maintaining grammatical accuracy and semantic similarity.
3. Benchmark attack success rates and identify vulnerabilities in NLP models.
4. Provide a structured environment to explore TextAttack’s modular components, such as goal functions, constraints, transformations, and search methods.

## Features of the Notebook

### 1. **TextAttack Modular Design**
The notebook uses the following key components of TextAttack:
- **Goal Function**: Determines whether an adversarial attack is successful by changing the model's predictions.
- **Constraints**: Ensures that generated adversarial examples maintain semantic similarity, grammatical correctness, and logical coherence.
- **Transformations**: Applies techniques like word swaps or embedding substitutions to create perturbations in the input text.
- **Search Methods**: Utilizes algorithms (e.g., Greedy Word Swap with Word Importance Ranking) to efficiently find impactful perturbations.

### 2. **Dataset and Models**
We used the **Rotten Tomatoes dataset** for sentiment classification tasks and tested attacks on pre-trained models like **BERT** or **WordCNN**. The goal was to generate adversarial examples that change the model's predictions without compromising the text's integrity.

### 3. **Benchmarking and Results**
The notebook benchmarks the success of adversarial attacks. Specifically:
- An **untargeted classification attack** was implemented, aiming to flip the model’s predictions.
- Using the **Greedy Word Swap with Word Importance Ranking (Greedy-WIR)** search method, we achieved an **attack success rate of 81.77%**. This means that adversarial examples successfully altered the model's predictions in 81.77% of cases.

## Attack Success Rate: 81.77%

The **81.77% attack success rate** was achieved by:
1. **Combining Modular Components**:
   - The attack recipe used **goal functions** to guide successful adversarial example generation.
   - **Constraints** ensured that the generated perturbations retained semantic and grammatical consistency.
   - **Transformations** applied perturbations, such as word swaps, to alter input texts effectively.

2. **Using Efficient Search Methods**:
   - The **Greedy-WIR** method ranked words by their importance and prioritized impactful replacements to maximize success.

3. **Leveraging Pre-Trained Models**:
   - The attack targeted pre-trained models like BERT or WordCNN, tested on the Rotten Tomatoes dataset, a benchmark for sentiment classification.

4. **Framework Features**:
   - TextAttack efficiently benchmarks adversarial attacks across various models, ensuring comparable and reproducible results.
